# oc_js_list_of_links
This project creates a link listing page with JavaScript. This is the final exercise of Open Classroom's "Use JavaScript in your web projects" course.

## The instructions were as follows:

You're going to take an existing project -- a list of links, displayed one by one with JavaScript -- and add new functionality that lets users add their own links to the list.
 
* The form should appear when clicking on the button "Add link".
* Entering Title, Author and URL link is mandatory.
* If the entered URL does not begin with "http: //" or "https: //", it adds "http: //" at the beginning.
* When the user validates the new link, it is added at the top of the page, the add form disappears and an 
  information message is displayed for 2 seconds.
* JavaScript variables must respect camelCase standard and file weblinks.js must be properly indented.
